Using PROOF with gLite -- RGLite plug-in and gLitePROOF package (30') 	Anar Manafov (GSI)

Using the gLitePROOF package it is possible to perform PROOF-based distributed data analysis on the gLite Grid. The LHC experiments managed to run globally distributed Monte Carlo productions on the Grid, now the development of tools for data analysis stands in the foreground. To grant access interfaces must be provided. The ROOT/PROOF framework is used as a starting point. Using abstract ROOT classes (TGrid, ...) interfaces can be implemented, via which Grid access from ROOT can be accomplished. A concrete implementation exists for the ALICE Grid environment AliEn. Within the D-Grid project an interface to the common Grid middleware of all LHC experiments, gLite, has been created. Herewith it is possible to query Grid File Catalogues from ROOT for the location of the data to be analysed. Grid jobs can be submitted into a gLite based Grid. The status of the jobs can be asked for. The results can be obtained.
